I started to seriously take on coding in 2020 in a coding Bootcamp, like a lot of people in that time. Before I got a degree in arts, music and media and was tipping my toes in music journalism and theatre work. I loved the field, but started doodling around in programming as a hobby and had a lot of fun to play around with HTML, CSS and the fundamentals of the web in general. I then got the chance to go to Barcelona and do the bootcamp with a scholarship, and with the possibility to work on a project directly after graduating, I commited to the field fully.

From the first exitement of making a button to a funny thing to your site to thinking about important factors that makie a web service performant and useful, I am still a fan of working with the web and its principles. 
I can get easily hooked with highly interactive projects, but I also admire a simple, thoughtfully crafted site where the basics of web dev are well implied.

In my free time I still enjoy it a lot to engage with music, learn new instruments, sing in choirs and to go out for a nice stroll.

I planning to make this place my digital playground, where I can try some new things that are cool and fun, show it to people who might be interested and chat about it.
