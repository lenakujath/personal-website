I started to seriously pick up coding in 2020 by taking part in a coding Bootcamp, like a lot of people, curious about pursuing web development in a professional manner, did around that time. Before that, I obtained a degree in arts, music and media and was tipping my toes in music journalism and theatre work. I loved the field, but started doodling around in programming as a hobby and had a lot of fun getting to know HTML, CSS and the fundamentals of the web in general. I then got the chance to go to Barcelona by being accepted for a bootcamp supported by a scholarship, and using the possibility to work on a project directly after graduating, I commited to the field fully.

From the first excitement of making a button do a funny thing to your page to thinking about important factors that makie a web service performant and useful, I am still a fan of working with the web and whitin principles. 
I can get easily hooked with highly interactive projects, but I also admire a simple, thoughtfully crafted site where the basics of web dev are applied well.

In my free time I still enjoy a lot engaging with music, learning new instruments, singing in choirs or just going out for a nice stroll spending time in nature.

I am planning to make this place my digital playground, where I can try some new things that are cool and fun, show it to people who might be interested and provide the option to chat about it later.
