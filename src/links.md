### [Messenger](https://messenger.abeto.co)

A beautiful browser game and web experience, which deserve the name, made by [abeto.co](https://abeto.co/). Everything from design, music, wording to development is absolutely stunning. Besides, they did a great job performance wise. Strolling through this virtual town delights me every time.

The personal website of Eva Decker, a design engineer. Interesting [articles](https://eva.town/garden) to browse through, cool nostalgic [guestbook](https://eva.town/guestbook) feature and the virtual piano on her homepage is one of the things I love the web for.

### [MTV Rewind](https://wantmymtv.vercel.app/player.html)

For everyone, who still remembers the days when MTV was playing music videos all day, this place should be a real treasure. Kudos for such a cool idea. Chances that this site will pull me in and gets me stucked for hours at a time are high.

When it comes to reading high quality articles on web development this is one of my favorite places to go. Their approach is super fun and their writing is great. Most of the times, you can get something out of it (almost) regardless of your current level of knowledge - which is hard to achieve. 
There is so much love to the craft and attention to detail in everything published. Consider me a fan. It also might be a good place to lead people to who think that frontend development is merely about putting funny colors on a website.
