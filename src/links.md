When it comes to reading high quality articles on web development this is one of my favorite places to go. Their approach is super fun and their writing is great. Most of the times, you can get something out of it (almost) regardless of your current level of knowledge - which is hard to achieve. 
There is so much love to the craft and attention to detail in everything published. Consider me a fan. It also might be a good place to lead people to who think that frontend development is merely about putting funny colors on a website.
