Here you find the source code to my personal website.

It is built using Elventy, a static stite generator. 
I made myself familiar with it just recently and the limited experience I have with has been remarkably positive.

If you want to check it out yourself, the documentation is very good: https://www.11ty.dev/docs

I was hugely inspired to finally create my own space on the web by [Sophie Koonin](https://github.com/sophiekoonin) among others, whose articles I appreciate very much 
and who has also a fun website. Besides running an informative blog, you can switch between different themes and check out 
some of her projects at https://localghost.dev.
Her [Repo](https://github.com/sophiekoonin/localghost) also helped me a lot to figure out the basics of this SSG.
