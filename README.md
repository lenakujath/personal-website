Here you find the source code to my personal website.

It is built with the static stite generator Elventy. 
I made myself familiar with it just recently and the limited experience I have with is absolutely positive.

If you want to check it out yourself, the documentation is great: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/

I was hugely inspired to finally create my own space on the web by Sophie Koonin, whose articles I appreciate very much 
and who has also a fun website. Besides running an informative blog, you can switch between different themes and check out 
some of her projects.
